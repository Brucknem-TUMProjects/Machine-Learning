\begin{flushleft}
a)\\
$h(x)=g_2(g_1(x))$ is not convex in this context:\\
Since $g_2$ and $g_1$ are convex: $g_2''\geq0$ and $g_1''\geq0$ but $g_2$ can 
be decreasing so $g_2'(x)$ does not have to be positive $\forall x$.
\begin{align*}
[h(x)]' &= g_2'(g_1(x))*g_1'(x)\\
[h(x)]'' &= [g_2'(g_1(x))*g_1'(x)]'\\
[h(x)]'' &= g_2''(g_1(x))*(g_1'(x))^2 + g_2'(g_1(x))*g_1''(x)
\end{align*}
So $[h(x)]''$ can be $\leq 0$ if $g_2'(g_1(x)) \leq 0$ ($(g_1'(x))^2$ is 
always $\geq 0$)
\end{flushleft}
\begin{flushleft}
b)\\
$h(x)=g_2(g_1(x))$ is convex in this context:\\
Since $g_2$ and $g_1$ are convex: $g_2''\geq0$ and $g_1''\geq0$ also $g_2$ is 
non-decreasing so $g_2'(x) \geq 0$.
\begin{align*}
[h(x)]' &= g_2'(g_1(x))*g_1'(x)\\
[h(x)]'' &= [g_2'(g_1(x))*g_1'(x)]'\\
[h(x)]'' &= g_2''(g_1(x))*(g_1'(x))^2 + g_2'(g_1(x))*g_1''(x)
\end{align*}
So $[h(x)]''$ can only be $\geq 0$. ($(g_1'(x))^2$ is always $\geq 0$)
\end{flushleft}
\begin{flushleft}
c)\\
$h(x)=max(g_1(x),...,g_n(x))$ is always convex:\\
\begin{align*}
h(\lambda x+ (1- \lambda)y) &= max(g_1(\lambda x+ (1- \lambda)y), ... , 
g_n(\lambda x+ (1- \lambda)y)\\
&\leq max(\lambda g_1(x) + (1-\lambda)g_1(y),...,\lambda g_n(x) + (1-\lambda)g_n(y))\\
&\leq max(\lambda g_1(x), ... , \lambda g_n(x)) + max(\lambda g_1(y), ... , \lambda g_n(y))\\
&= \lambda h(x) + (1-\lambda)h(y)
