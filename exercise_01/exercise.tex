%
\Problem{1}
Dimensions of matrices $A, B, C, D, E, F$
%
\begin{align}
	A \in \Matrix{M}{N}, \qquad B &\in \Matrix{1}{M}, \qquad C \in \Matrix{N}{P}\\
	D \in \Vector{Q}, \qquad B &\in \Matrix{N}{N}, \qquad C \in \Vector{1}
\end{align}%
%
\Problem{2}
$f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{j=1}^{N}x_ix_jM_{ij}$ using only matrix-vector multiplications.
%
\begin{align}
	f(x) = x^TMx
\end{align}
%
%
\Problem{3}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Conditions for unique solution $x$ for any choice of $b$ in $Ax=b$ 
	\subitem $rank(A)=M,\qquad det(A) \neq 0,\qquad ker(A) = \{0\}$
	
	\item Unique solution $x$ for any choice of $b$ in $Ax=b$ with eigenvalues of A: $\{-5,0,1,1,3\}$
	\subitem $det(A) = \prod_{i}\lambda_i = -5*0*1*1*3 = 0 \implies$ No unique solution
\end{enumerate}
%
%
\Problem{4}
Properties of eigenvalues of $A$ in $BA = AB = I$
%
\begin{align}
BA = AB = I \implies B = A^{-1}
\end{align}
A has to be invertable $\implies det(A) \neq 0 \implies \forall i: \lambda_i \neq 0$
%
\Problem{5}
$A$ is PSD if and only if it has no negative eigenvalues\\
%
Definition of eigenvalue: $Ax = \lambda x$
%
\begin{align}
	PSD &\Leftrightarrow x^TAx \geq 0\\
	PSD &\Leftrightarrow x^TAx = x^T \lambda x = \lambda x^T x = \lambda \sum_{i} x_i^2 \geq 0\\
	\sum_{i} x_i^2 &\geq_{always} 0 \implies \forall \lambda: \lambda \geq 0
\end{align}
%
%
\Problem{6}
$B = A^T A$ is PSD for any $A$
%
\begin{align}
	B = A^T A &\implies Bx = \lambda_B x = A^T A x = \lambda_A \lambda_A x = \lambda_A^2 x\\
	\lambda_B = \lambda_A^2 &\implies \lambda_B \geq_{always} 0
\end{align}
B has to be PSD for any choice of A. \qquad \ensuremath{\square}
