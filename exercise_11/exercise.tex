\Problem{1}
%
\begin{flushleft}
Leslie: Votes 3 for Alien, 4 for Titanic.\\
Originial space: $[0, 3, 0, 0, 4]$\\
To obtain the wanted concept space a projection from original space to concept space is needed.\\
(script page 67)
\begin{align*}
P &= A * V \\
P &= [0, 4, 0, 0, 4] *
\begin{bmatrix}
0.58 & 0 \\
0.58 & 0 \\
0.58 & 0 \\
0 & 0.71 \\
0 & 0.71 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\\
P &= [1.74, 2.84]
\end{align*}
This means Leslie will most likely favor the Titanic and Casablanca movies (score: 2.84) over the sci-fi genre (score: 1.74). She already rated Titanic, which means she has already seen it, so Casablanca would be a good recommendation.\\
\end{flushleft}

\Problem{2}
%
\begin{flushleft}
Integrating out z (script page 31):\\
$x_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \, W W^{T} + \sigma^{2}I)$\\
$x$ has a gaussian distribution with mean $\mu$ and covariance 
$W W^{T} + \sigma^{2}I = W W^{T} + \Phi$.\\
$y = Ax$ is a linear transformation $\implies$ $y$ has still a gaussian distribution.\\
$y$ now has a mean of $A\mu$ and a covariance of $AW W^{T}A^{T} + A \Phi A^{T}$.\\
(Because the covariance after a linear transformation with A is $cov(AZ)=Acov(Z)A^{T}$.)\\
If $\mu_{ML}$, $W_{ML}$, $\Phi_{ML}$ represent the max. likelihood solution before the transformation, $A\mu_{ML}$, $AW_{ML}$, $A\Phi_{ML}A^{T}$ will represent the max. likelihood solution after a transformation with $A$.\\
$A$ is orthogonal $\implies AA^{T}=I$, which means $A \Phi A^{T} = A \sigma^{2}I A^{T} = \sigma^{2}I A A^{T} = \sigma^{2}I I = \sigma^{2}I^{2} = \sigma^{2}I$\\
Which means the form of the model is preserved.
