False, the feature test performed in a node is done by only evaluating one feature to split the training data. Therefore decision boundaries can only be parallel to the axis respectivly. This means that a decision tree at depth 1 can never produce a diagonal as shown in the plot. For that reason a huge depth would be needed to approximate the diagonal.
