\Problem{1}
%
\begin{flushleft}
Constraints:\\
\begin{align}
\theta_1 + \theta_2 \leq 12 &\implies \theta_2 \leq 12 - \theta_1\\
- \theta_1 + 2\theta_2 \geq -3 &\implies \theta_2 \geq \frac{\theta_1-3}{2}\\
- 5\theta_1 + 3\theta_2 \leq -4 &\implies \theta_2 \leq \frac{1}{3}(5\theta_1-4)\\
\theta_2 \geq 2\\
\theta_1 \geq 2
\end{align}
Plot: Axis along $x$-dimension: $\theta_1$, Axis along $y$-dimension: $\theta_2$, simply plot the functions (1) up to (5):
\begin{align*}
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{graphs/graph_1.png}
\end{align*}
$f(\theta)=2\theta_1 -3\theta_2$ Minimizer and maximizer both need to be a corner vertex of the domain.\\
Simple testing against $(2,2)$, $(7,2)$, $(9,3)$ and $(5,7)$ shows the solution:\\
Minimizer $\theta_{min} = (5,7) f(\theta_{min})= -11$\\
Maximizer $\theta_{max} = (9,3) f(\theta_{max})= 9$\\
