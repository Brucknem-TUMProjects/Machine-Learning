\Topic{Optimization}

\Problem{1}
%
\begin{flushleft}
Since $f_0$ is a hyperplane, the min and max values are at the vertices:
\end{flushleft}
\begin{align*}
  f_0((9,3)^T) = -2 \;\;\;\;\;& f_0((5,7)^T) = -11 \\ f_0((7,2)^T) = 8 \;\;\;\;\;& f_0((9,3)^T) = 10
\end{align*}
\begin{flushleft}
  We immediately see that $\theta_\text{min} = (5,7)^T$ and $\theta_\text{max} = (9,3)^T$ and also $\mathrm{min}(f_0) = -11$ and $\mathrm{max}(f_0) = 10$.
\end{flushleft}
%
%
\Problem{2}
%
\begin{equation*}
  \pi_\chi(p) = 
  \begin{cases}
    {\color{magenta}p} & {\color{magenta}\text{if } p\in \chi} \\
    {\color{forestgreen}(1.5,2.5)^T} & {\color{forestgreen}\text{if $p$ is in the green corridor}} \\
    {\color{red}(3,1)^T} & {\color{red}\text{if $p$ is in the red corridor}} \\
    {\color{blue}\begin{pmatrix}
      \frac{1}{2} p_1 - \frac{1}{2} p_2 + 2 \\
      \frac{1}{2} - p_1 + \frac{1}{2} p_2 + 2 \\
    \end{pmatrix}} & {\color{blue}\text{if $p$ is in the blue corridor}} \\
    {\color{orange}\begin{pmatrix}
      \mathrm{max}(0, \mathrm{min}(3, p_1)) \\
      \mathrm{max}(0, \mathrm{min}(2.5, p_2))
    \end{pmatrix}} & {\color{orange}\text{if $p$ is outside green/red/blue corridor and } pÂ \not\in \chi}
    \end{cases} 
\end{equation*}
\begin{flushleft}
The blue corridor projects down to a line. We can take any two points on the line to calculate the projection vector $\pi_{\chi_{a,b}}$. We choose $\mathbf{a}:=(0,4)^T$ and $\mathbf{b}:=(4,0)^T$ for simplicity.
\end{flushleft}
\begin{align*}
  \pi_{\chi_{a,b}} &= a + \frac{(\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{a})^T (\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a})}{\Vert \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a} \Vert^2_2} (\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a})  \\
  &= \left(\begin{smallmatrix}0 \\ 4 \end{smallmatrix}\right) + \frac{\left(\begin{smallmatrix}p_1 - 0 \\ p_2 - 4 \end{smallmatrix}\right)^T \left(\begin{smallmatrix}4 \\ -4 \end{smallmatrix}\right)}{32} \left(\begin{smallmatrix}4 \\ -4 \end{smallmatrix}\right) \\
  &= \left(\begin{smallmatrix}0 \\ 4 \end{smallmatrix}\right) + \frac{4p_1 - 4p_2 + 16}{32} \left(\begin{smallmatrix}4 \\ -4 \end{smallmatrix}\right) \\
  &= \left(\begin{smallmatrix}0 \\ 4 \end{smallmatrix}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{8} p_1 - \frac{1}{8} p_2 + \frac{1}{2} \right) \left(\begin{smallmatrix}4 \\ -4 \end{smallmatrix}\right) \\
  &=\begin{pmatrix}
      \frac{1}{2} p_1 - \frac{1}{2} p_2 + 2 \\
      \frac{1}{2} - p_1 + \frac{1}{2} p_2 + 2 \\
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
