\Topic{Constrained Optimization}
%
\Problem{1}
%
\begin{flushleft}
Constraints:\\
\begin{align}
\theta_1 + \theta_2 \leq 12 &\implies \theta_2 \leq 12 - \theta_1\\
- \theta_1 + 2\theta_2 \geq -3 &\implies \theta_2 \geq \frac{\theta_1-3}{2}\\
- 5\theta_1 + 3\theta_2 \leq -4 &\implies \theta_2 \leq \frac{1}{3}(5\theta_1-4)\\
\theta_2 \geq 2\\
\theta_1 \geq 2
\end{align}
Plot: Axis along $x$-dimension: $\theta_1$, Axis along $y$-dimension: $\theta_2$, simply plot the functions (1) up to (5):
\begin{align*}
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{graphs/graph_1.png}
\end{align*}
$f(\theta)=2\theta_1 -3\theta_2$ Minimizer and maximizer both need to be a corner vertex of the domain.\\
Simple testing against $(2,2)$, $(7,2)$, $(9,3)$ and $(5,7)$ shows the solution:\\
Minimizer $\theta_{min} = (5,7) f(\theta_{min})= -11$\\
Maximizer $\theta_{max} = (9,3) f(\theta_{max})= 9$\\
\end{flushleft}

\Problem{2}
%
\begin{flushleft}
a)\\
Constraints:\\
\begin{align*}
\theta_1 + \theta_2 \leq 4\qquad \qquad(1)\\
0 \leq \theta_1 \leq 3\qquad \qquad(2)\\
0 \leq \theta_2 \leq 2.5\qquad \qquad(3)
\end{align*}
Plot: Axis along $x$-dimension: $\theta_1$, Axis along $y$-dimension: $\theta_2$, simply plot the functions (1) up to (3):
\begin{align*}
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{graphs/graph_2.png}
\end{align*}
Domain corner vertices: $(0,0)$, $(3,0)$, $(3,1)$, $(1.5,2.5)$, $(0,2.5)$\\
Domain regions: Domain (inside), box, line, $(3,1)$, $(1.5,2.5)$\\
\begin{align*}
\pi_\mathcal{X}(p) &= p \text{ if } p \in \text{ Domain (inside)}\\
\pi_\mathcal{X}(p) &= (3,1) \text{ if } p \in \text{ Region (3,1) }\\
\pi_\mathcal{X}(p) &= (1.5,2.5) \text{ if } p \in \text{ Region (1.5,2.5)}\\
\pi_\mathcal{X}(p) &= \pi_{line} \text{ if } p \in \text{ Region line}\\
\pi_\mathcal{X}(p) &= \pi_{box} \text{ if } p \in \text{ Region box}\\
\end{align*}
\begin{align*}
p \in \text{ Domain (inside)} &= \{p | p \in \mathcal{X}\}\\
p \in \text{ Region (3,1) } &= \{p | p_2 \geq 1 \land -p_1 + p_2 \leq -2\}\\
p \in \text{ Region (1.5,2.5)} &= \{p | p_1  \geq 1.5 \land -p_1+p_2 \geq 1\}\\
p \in \text{ Region line} &= \{p | p_1 +p_2 > 4 \land -2 < -p_1+p_2 < 1\}\\
p \in \text{ Region box} &= \{p | p \notin \mathcal{X} \land (p_1 < 1.5 \lor p_2 < 1)\}\\
\end{align*}
Let $a$ be $(4,0)$ and let $b$ be $(0,4)$:\\ 
\begin{align*}
\pi_{line}(p) &= a + \frac{(p-a)^{T}(b-a)}{||b-a||^{2}_{2}}(b-a)\\
&= \begin{pmatrix}4\\0\end{pmatrix} + \frac{(p_1-4, p_2)\begin{pmatrix}-4\\4\end{pmatrix}}{32} \begin{pmatrix}-4\\4\end{pmatrix}\\
&= \begin{pmatrix}4\\0\end{pmatrix} + \frac{16-4p_1+4p_2}{32} \begin{pmatrix}-4\\4\end{pmatrix}\\
&= \begin{pmatrix}4\\0\end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix}2-\frac{1}{2}p_1+\frac{1}{2}p_2\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}-1\\1\end{pmatrix}\\
&=\begin{pmatrix}2+\frac{1}{2}p_1-\frac{1}{2}p_2\\2-\frac{1}{2}p_1+\frac{1}{2}p_2\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
Formula taken from the lecture:
\begin{align*}
\pi_{box}(p) &= \begin{pmatrix}max(0, min(3, p_1))\\max(0, min(2.5, p_2))\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
