\Topic{SVM and Kernels}
%
\Problem{1}
%
\begin{flushleft}
Similarities: \\
Both try to find a fitting hyperplane which seperates the data classes.\\
Difference: \\
SVM tries to maximize the margin from the hyperplane to the data points, perceptron algorithms only care about a valid seperation of the data classes.
\end{flushleft}

\Problem{2}

\begin{flushleft}
a)\\
$g(\alpha)$ vectorized definition:
\begin{align*}
g(\alpha) = \frac{1}{2}\alpha^{T}Q\alpha + \alpha^{T}1_{N}
\end{align*}
$g(\alpha)$ standard definition:
\begin{align*}
g(\alpha) = \sum_{i=1}^{N}\alpha_{i}-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{j=1}^{N}
y_{i}y_{j}\alpha_{i}\alpha_{j}x^{T}_{i}x_{j}
\end{align*}
$y$ is a vector of dimension $N\times 1$\\
$x$ is a matrix of dimension $N\times M$\\
$\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{j=1}^{N}y_{i}y_{j}$ is equivalent to $yy^{T}$ 
(dimension is $N\times N$)\\
$\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{j=1}^{N}x^{T}_{i}x_{j}$ is equivalent to $XX^{T}$ 
(dimension is $N\times N$)\\
$\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{j=1}^{N}y_{i}y_{j}x^{T}_{i}x_{j}$ is the Hadamard product so:
$[yy^{T} \odot XX^{T}]$\\
Take the $-1$ scalar from the standard definition into the matrix: 
$[-yy^{T} \odot XX^{T}] = Q$\\
$\implies \frac{1}{2}\alpha^{T}Q\alpha \equiv \frac{1}{2}\alpha^{T}[-yy^{T} 
\odot XX^{T}]\alpha \equiv -\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{j=1}^{N}y_{i}y_{j}\alpha_{i}
\alpha_{j}x^{T}_{i}x_{j}$\\
$\alpha^{T}1_{N} \equiv \sum_{i=1}^{N}\alpha_{i}$ is trivial.\\
$\implies$ $g(\alpha)$ vectorized definition $\equiv$ $g(\alpha)$ standard definition
